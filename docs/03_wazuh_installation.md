# Wazuh Server Installation

## Step 1 – Initial configuration
I started the Wazuh VM and logged in using the default credentials for this test.<br>
login: wazuh-user Password:wazuh . <br>

In the Wazuh server console, I ran the `ip a` command to check which IP address was assigned via DHCP.

After completing the installation of Fedora, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux, and ensuring that the VMs were in bridge mode on the same network as the Wazuh server, I verified the IP addresses they obtained and confirmed that they could ping each other without issues.
