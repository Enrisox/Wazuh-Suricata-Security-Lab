# Introduction

I have decided not to publish the commands of the attacking counterpart and to publish only the alerts generated, integrating as many of them as possible during the time I develop this project, which I consider very interesting. Wazuh is a powerful, open-source, and increasingly utilized tool, but not the easiest to learn, but my goal is to master it.

## Hardware Available for Testing

- Personal host PC with VirtualBox installed (AMD 7900, 12 cores, 32 GB DDR5 RAM)
- Wazuh OVA (Open Virtualization Appliance) downloaded
- Ubuntu and Kali Linux ISO images
- MikroTik HAP AC Lite router
- Virtual machines configured in bridge mode within the lab
