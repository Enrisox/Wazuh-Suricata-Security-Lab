# Wazuh: Install & enroll the agent
To get started, I installed the Wazuh agent on each VM, except for the Kali Linux VM, which will act as the attacker, by clicking the blue "Deploy New Agent" button. <br>

I entered the Wazuh server IP, selected the operating system where I would install the agent, gave it a name, and chose a group to assign it to. Finally, I simply copied the commands generated by the interface—a straightforward process that reminded me of how I used to install the Acronis Cyber Backup agent on new machines belonging to client company tenants during my recent internship at Cloudfire as a Cloud Engineer.<br>
