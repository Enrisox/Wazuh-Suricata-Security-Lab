# STEP 1 : Wazuh: Install & enroll the agent
To get started, I installed the Wazuh agent on each VM, except for the Kali Linux VM (which will act as the attacker), by clicking the blue "Deploy New Agent" button. <br>

I entered the Wazuh server IP, selected the operating system where I would install the agent, gave it a name, and chose a group to assign it to. Finally, I simply copied the commands generated by the interface—a straightforward process that reminded me of how I used to install the **Acronis Cyber Backup agent** on new machines belonging to client company tenants during my recent internship at Cloudfire as a **Cloud Engineer**.<br>

The installation process for the Debian and Ubuntu agents is basically just slightly different.<br>

I repeated the same process for the Ubuntu VM and verified the status of the Wazuh agent on both machines using the command `**sudo systemctl status wazuh-agent** <br>

If the agents were installed correctly and connected to the Wazuh server, they should appear as **active** in the dashboard. In this lab, the VM where I will install Suricata will be only the Ubuntu VM, so the Fedora VM will remain powered off and its agent will show as **disconnected**.
